Residents of the Malevia country often experiment with the plan of their rooms.
Rooms can be triangular, rectangular and round. To quickly calculate the floorage
it is required to write a program, which gets the type of the room shape and the
relevant parameters as input - the program should output the area of the resulting room.
The value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia.
